## Introduction

youtube reader is a simple site that transforms youtube videos into articles. For when you would rather just read a blog post than watch a video.

This is a hybrid Next.js + Python app that uses Next.js as the frontend and FastAPI as the API backend.

## How It Works

The Python/FastAPI server is mapped into to Next.js app under `/api/`.

This is implemented using [`next.config.js` rewrites](https://github.com/digitros/nextjs-fastapi/blob/main/next.config.js) to map any request to `/api/:path*` to the FastAPI API, which is hosted in the `/api` folder.

On localhost, the rewrite will be made to the `127.0.0.1:8000` port, which is where the FastAPI server is running.

In production, the FastAPI server is hosted as [Python serverless functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes/python) on Vercel.

## Developing Locally

You can clone & create this repo with the following command

```bash
npx create-next-app nextjs-fastapi --example "https://github.com/josephrmartinez/youtubereader"
```

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The FastApi server will be running on [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) – feel free to change the port in `package.json` (you'll also need to update it in `next.config.js`).
